## [Unreleased]

### Added — M0, architecture foundation

**Domain model** (`core/types`)
- Raw-preserving HTTP message model: ordered duplicate-tolerant headers, original
  casing, byte bodies, framing-ambiguity detection for smuggling work.
- Type-distinct UUIDv7 identifiers.
- Scope model with deny-wins semantics, path normalization (percent-decoding and
  dot-segment removal), IPv4/IPv6 literal handling and subdomain wildcards.
- Testing identities with privilege ordering for authorization testing.
- Evidence-driven finding model; findings cannot claim confidence they have not earned.
- Resource limits, including two-sided decompression-bomb protection.
- `Secret<T>` wrapper: no `Display`, redacted `Debug`, explicit `.expose()`.

**Storage** (`core/storage`)
- Metadata/body split: SQLite for metadata, content-addressed blob store for bodies.
- Filesystem blob store with SHA-256 addressing, deduplication, atomic writes,
  two-level sharding and integrity verification on read.
- Transactional forward-only migrations; a newer schema is refused, not downgraded.
- Backend-agnostic repository interfaces with mandatory cursor pagination.

**Engine** (`core/engine`)
- Single transport boundary through which all requests pass.
- `ScopeGuard`: automated subsystems cannot send out-of-scope traffic; human-driven
  requests are flagged rather than blocked.
- Extension permission model that can only be narrowed after grant.
- AI tool-permission gate; credential access forbidden outright.

**Applications**
- `hexora` CLI: `project init`, `project info`, `version`.
- Tauri + React desktop shell reporting engine status and checking IPC contract version.

**Project**
- CI: fmt, clippy (deny warnings), test, frontend typecheck and build, desktop check,
  dependency audit.
- Documentation: architecture, threat model, storage, security invariants, development
  guide, roadmap.
- AGPL-3.0-or-later.

### Fixed — M0 compiler and security gate

First run of the code against an actual compiler. Six defects that static review missed:

- `hexora-storage`: pooled connection could not coerce to `&Connection` through `?` (E0308).
- `hexora-cli`: a helper returned an array of references to its own parameters (E0515);
  replaced with `rusqlite::params!` at the call site.
- `clippy::if_same_then_else` in path normalization; two branches merged.
- `clippy::manual_range_contains` in a storage test.
- Tauri `#[tauri::command]` in the crate root collided with its own generated
  re-export (E0255); the IPC surface moved to `commands.rs`, which is better structure
  anyway — the command list is the desktop client's whole attack surface.
- Missing `icons/icon.ico`, required by `tauri-build` on Windows. Icons are now
  generated reproducibly by `scripts/generate_icons.py`.

Also: a false-positive test. `no_temporary_files_are_left_behind` matched `.tmp`
anywhere in the path, and `tempfile::tempdir()` names its directory `.tmpXXXXXX`, so
every blob looked like a leftover. Now matches file names only.

### Security

- **`Secret<T>` no longer implements `Serialize`.** It was `#[serde(transparent)]`, so
  `serde_json::to_string` on an `Identity` emitted the credential in cleartext — a leak
  through exports and IPC that a redacting `Debug` did nothing to prevent. Deriving
  `Serialize` over a secret is now a compile error. Persistence must opt in per field
  through the new `redact::exposed` adapter. `Credential` and `Identity` are
  consequently not `Serialize`.
- Removed a Base64 Basic Authentication literal from a test. It was RFC 7617's own
  worked example (`aladdin:opensesame`) and therefore not a live credential, but it is
  indistinguishable from one to a scanner or a reviewer skimming a diff. The test now
  decodes the header and asserts against obviously-fake fixtures.
- Added a `gitleaks` CI job scanning full history. There was no secret scanning before.
- CI toolchain pinned to 1.98 in every job. Previously CI installed `stable` and cargo
  then silently auto-installed a different compiler from `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- MSRV corrected from 1.85 to 1.88 — the floor imposed by Tauri's dependency graph.

### Not implemented
